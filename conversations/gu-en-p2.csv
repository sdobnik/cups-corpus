P02	1	1	So how many cups do you see? And what colours are they?
P02	2	2	i'm going to break it down into different colours
P02	2	3	i see 2 yellow cups
P02	2	4	3 red
P02	2	5	3 blue
P02	1	6	I see 6 white, 4 red, 3 blue, and 2 yellow.
P02	2	7	7 white - 2 of which are like takeaway coffee mugs and 2 are like the other coloured ones with handles
P02	1	8	Yeah, I have those styrofoam cups too. They are only white. Of the six white cups, 2 are those takeaway ones.
P02	1	9	So maybe we could possibly go row by row, do you think? And say which cups are there? Or how should we work out where your unique cups are and vice versa?
P02	2	10	yeh. i think all the coloured cups i can see have handles. but there is one red one at the far end that isn't 100% clear
P02	2	11	yeh let's do that, row by row sounds good
P02	1	12	Yes, me too. All the coloured ones have handles except one red one in the middle (I can't see the handle because it is turned from me).
P02	1	13	Ok.
P02	1	14	On my first row. I have from the left (your right): one red, handle turned to you but I can see it. A blue cup next. Handle turned to my right. A white with handle turned to right. Then a red with handle turned to my left.
P02	2	15	first row = row nearest you?
P02	1	16	Yes.
P02	2	17	ok then i think we found a cup of yours that i can't see: the red with the handle to your left (the last one you mention)
P02	1	18	Okay, that would make sense. Maybe it is blocked by the other cups in front or something?
P02	2	19	yeh, i have a blue one and a white one, either of which could be blocking it
P02	1	20	Yes, I think I see those.
P02	1	21	It looks almost like a diagonal line to me. From a red cup really close to you on your left, then a white, then the blue, then this missing red.
P02	2	22	blue with the handle to my left and white with the handle to my rigth/towards me a bit
P02	2	23	ok cool
P02	2	24	so the red one is quite close to the edge of the table?
P02	1	25	Yes very
P02	1	26	You know this white one you just mentioned. Is it a takeaway cup?
P02	1	27	Because I think I know which cup that is but I don't see the handle.
P02	2	28	no, i was referring to the white handled cup to the right of the blue cup in the second row from you. its handle faces... south east from my perspective
P02	2	29	the second row of cups from your end
P02	1	30	Yes, I understand now!
P02	1	31	Gotcha
P02	1	32	Shall we take my next row? Which is actually just a styrofoam cup. It's kinda marooned between the two rows.
P02	2	33	ok, one sec, i'll draw on the missing red cup on the edge of the table
P02	1	34	Np
P02	1	35	Frankie
P02	2	36	which way is its handle facing exactly?
P02	1	37	The red cup handle faces to my left, your right.
P02	2	38	parallel to the edge of the table where you
P02	2	39	*you're standing
P02	1	40	Yes
P02	1	41	If the table has four corners, this is very close to the corner on my right.
P02	2	42	ok, i drew it. it looks like a tea pot
P02	1	43	Hahaha, okay.
P02	2	44	ok, so your next row
P02	2	45	you said there's a takeaway cup somewhere marooned all alone
P02	1	46	Okay. So we have that row I described with the now found red cup. Then a takeaway cup that is between that row and the next. It's very much in the middle of the two rows.
P02	2	47	ok
P02	2	48	i have an idea
P02	1	49	Like if we cut the table in half, straight down the middle...the cup would drop to the floor.
P02	1	50	Ok.
P02	2	51	perhaps we can mark each of the corners of the table with a letter, and use them like coordinates
P02	2	52	or is that cheating?
P02	1	53	I don't think it's cheating if we're not talking.
P02	1	54	I think!
P02	2	55	should we ask?
P02	1	56	I would just do it haha.
P02	1	57	You mean like making coordinates?
P02	2	58	ok let's ;)
P02	2	59	yeh
P02	1	60	Okay, we can try.
P02	2	61	ok, let's say: that corner with the newly found red cup = A
P02	1	62	okay
P02	1	63	B on the other corner on my left, your right?
P02	2	64	we probably need some middle points
P02	1	65	Okay.
P02	2	66	if we have A B C evenly across the top, and 1 2 3 down the sides, would that work?
P02	1	67	We could divide it in to four parts or something. The line from that cup.
P02	1	68	Sure
P02	2	69	4 would make more sense, yeh
P02	1	70	By top, you mean from A?
P02	2	71	yeh
P02	1	72	A line nearest me
P02	1	73	Okay
P02	1	74	We can do 4
P02	1	75	We should have somewhat equal division
P02	1	76	If you get me
P02	2	77	yeh
P02	1	78	Which is the side to start with the numbers?
P02	1	79	From A going away from me towards you?
P02	2	80	i suppose that B is very close to the handle of the white cup in your first row?
P02	1	81	Yes
P02	1	82	B is very close to a white cup with the handle pointed towards that brown-jacketed lady
P02	1	83	Who enjoys staring
P02	2	84	and C on the non-handled end of the blue cup on the same row?
P02	1	85	Indeed
P02	1	86	Perfecto
P02	2	87	ok
P02	2	88	"so yeh, let's do number on ""Katie's"" edge of the table"
P02	1	89	This feels like we are going to sink a battleship
P02	1	90	Okay
P02	1	91	So 1 nearest the A?
P02	1	92	Just to confirm
P02	2	93	yeh, in teh same spot?
P02	1	94	Okay
P02	2	95	i've forgotten how coordinates work haha
P02	1	96	I think we just make our own coordinates ahaha
P02	1	97	It will be fine
P02	2	98	ok, so A & 1 share that corner
P02	1	99	Okay
P02	1	100	I'm putting 4 right at the other end.
P02	2	101	and 4 at the other end
P02	2	102	snap
P02	1	103	Again in a straight line
P02	1	104	Yes
P02	2	105	so, 2 could be in line with a can you see a blue cup, that is behind the A1 red cup?
P02	2	106	lol thatÃ¤s not a sentence
P02	1	107	lmao
P02	2	108	"just take it from ""can you.."""
P02	1	109	just wait
P02	1	110	Yes. For me the blue cup is in front of the red cup. But yes.
P02	1	111	It has a handle that perhaps you can't see.
P02	1	112	Since it is pointing south east for me.
P02	2	113	"what do you mean by ""in front of"""
P02	1	114	Hmm
P02	2	115	closer to me or closer to you?
P02	1	116	Closer to you
P02	2	117	ok yep
P02	1	118	Okay
P02	2	119	i cna just see the handle almost pointing to A1
P02	1	120	Ah yes
P02	2	121	anyway, 2 in line with that cup?
P02	1	122	My 2 is not, no
P02	1	123	It's like
P02	1	124	Closer to 3
P02	1	125	I guess because the perspective of this table going away from us...the edges...are like diagonal. So it's harder to do exact numbers like we did the letters on the straight line if you get me?
P02	1	126	Also the print out
P02	2	127	yeh
P02	1	128	The perspective
P02	1	129	Is different
P02	1	130	From the computer screen
P02	1	131	Like the table seems more...angular on the print out
P02	1	132	At least to me
P02	2	133	yeh that's true
P02	1	134	Anyway, I can put my 2 near that blue cup
P02	2	135	"it's like it's being sucked into a vortex that is by ""katie's"" knee, from my perspective"
P02	1	136	ahahaha
P02	1	137	Poor Katie
P02	1	138	Katie
P02	1	139	I have just done the 2
P02	1	140	By the blue cup
P02	2	141	ok
P02	2	142	and the 3, mine falls sort of between a white handled and a yellow cup
P02	2	143	can you see a yellow cup, closest to me, handle facing my left
P02	1	144	Hmm, if I put my 3 there, there's like no room for the 4.
P02	1	145	Yes, I see that cup
P02	2	146	so you see that yellow cup to be right on teh corner?
P02	1	147	Yes
P02	1	148	A yellow cup, on my right your left, with the handle facing east to me, west to you.
P02	2	149	ok, from my perspective, there is at least a cup-sized gap between the edge of the table and the yellow cup
P02	1	150	Yes, I can say that too
P02	2	151	ok
P02	2	152	i put the 3 on the you side of that yellow cup
P02	1	153	Okay
P02	2	154	ok, let's see if that gets us anywhere
P02	1	155	Where is the 4?
P02	1	156	Never mind!
P02	1	157	Okay
P02	1	158	So
P02	2	159	ok i drew some lines to match up the coordinates to the other sides of the table
P02	2	160	though they are a bit tough to get right, with the odd table perspective
P02	1	161	It's kinda hard to concentrate
P02	1	162	With the semantics discussion
P02	2	163	yes
P02	1	164	Okay anyway
P02	1	165	So how should we proceed to figure out which other cups we both have that the other doesn't?
P02	2	166	ok, let's see
P02	2	167	you had 4 red and i had 3, so we found the missing red one
P02	1	168	Okay
P02	1	169	And there was a white cup discrepancy?
P02	1	170	I never wrote down your cups, which was clever
P02	1	171	I can scroll probably
P02	2	172	think so, i have 1 more white than you
P02	2	173	hah yeh me neither
P02	2	174	i just realised what i wrote about the white cups makes no sense
P02	2	175	i'll rewrite my stats
P02	2	176	RED: 3 handles + 1 newly found
P02	2	177	BLUE: 3 handles
P02	2	178	YELLOW: 2 handles
P02	2	179	WHITE: 5 handles + 2 takeway
P02	1	180	okay
P02	2	181	i'm so distracted
P02	1	182	I know
P02	1	183	It's a very interesting conversation ahaha
P02	1	184	"Right, we still have cups...""Frankie"""
P02	2	185	yes
P02	2	186	back to cups
P02	2	187	what are your cup stats?
P02	1	188	I have 4 red. This matches you now. I have 3 blue. Same as you. I have 4 white and 2 takeaway cups (we have a problem, Houston). And 2 yellow. Again, same as you.
P02	2	189	btw i have 15 total cups originally
P02	2	190	ok so we just have white left then
P02	1	191	I have 15 originally too
P02	1	192	Interesting
P02	2	193	2 takeaways are fine then
P02	2	194	so we're just one handled white
P02	1	195	Right
P02	1	196	So moving to my next row
P02	2	197	*on
P02	2	198	man i cannot type
P02	1	199	Past that other white marooned takeaway
P02	2	200	i'm a bit confused about your marooned takeaway
P02	2	201	what are its coordinates
P02	2	202	coordinates haha
P02	1	203	It would be B2 I guess
P02	1	204	But maybe just missing 2
P02	2	205	i see a white cup roughly there, but it's handled
P02	1	206	Near but not actually 2
P02	1	207	Yeah, there is a white cup near it
P02	1	208	But the white cup with the handle facing my west, your east...is like...a bit to the right of the takeaway.
P02	2	209	hmm
P02	2	210	i'm confused
P02	1	211	yes
P02	1	212	Well
P02	1	213	There is a white cup on the first row. Like B1.
P02	2	214	yeh
P02	1	215	And the takeaway is just in front of that.
P02	2	216	very near your crotch
P02	1	217	Ahahaha
P02	1	218	I can't see that
P02	1	219	But probably
P02	2	220	i don't think i can see that takeaway cup
P02	1	221	So we have white crotch cup. Takeaway. Then closer to you, on my right, your left...is another handled white cup.
P02	1	222	I see.
P02	2	223	white crotch up has a handle
P02	1	224	Wtf
P02	2	225	cup*
P02	1	226	Oh yeah
P02	1	227	The crotch cup does
P02	2	228	ok
P02	1	229	The handle faces to the east, your west
P02	2	230	yes
P02	1	231	okay
P02	2	232	so then on the edge of B1/2, i have another white handled cup
P02	2	233	is the marooned takeaway cup between these two?
P02	1	234	Yes
P02	2	235	ok
P02	2	236	closer to line B or line C?
P02	1	237	Closer to B. But almost halfway between C and B.
P02	2	238	ok
P02	2	239	i'ma draw it
P02	2	240	ok done
P02	1	241	Okay
P02	2	242	ok next row?
P02	1	243	Yes
P02	1	244	So. From say D almost 3. We have a yellow cup.
P02	1	245	The handle faces to your west.
P02	2	246	yeh
P02	1	247	Then we have a red cup. C2/3
P02	2	248	hmm
P02	1	249	I see no handle on it
P02	1	250	The handle must be facing you
P02	1	251	You should see it. There is nothing blocking it.
P02	2	252	i have a blue cup around that spot, but no red
P02	1	253	There is a blue cup just in front of it. Like...behind it for you I guess.
P02	2	254	can you see a blue cup there, handle facing my west
P02	1	255	Yes
P02	2	256	ah, it must be blocking it
P02	1	257	It's just in front
P02	2	258	just to be sure, on the side of the yellow cup we just mentioned that is closer to you, do you have 2 red cups between it and you?
P02	2	259	weird sentence
P02	1	260	Let me digest it
P02	1	261	Okay
P02	1	262	By the red cup
P02	1	263	On the right
P02	1	264	Is that mysterious red cup you can't see
P02	1	265	But the only red cup around that area
P02	1	266	Is a cup near D1
P02	1	267	On the first row
P02	2	268	so in that general end of the table, can you see 2 or 3 red cups?
P02	1	269	"Sorry. ""By the red cup"" after ""Okay"" should be ""By the yellow cup"""
P02	1	270	Near my end of the table?
P02	2	271	in the general C D side of the table
P02	2	272	that half
P02	2	273	cutting the table down the middle of B & C
P02	1	274	There's like one red cup realllly close to me. Really close to D. And then the only red cup on the C and D rows...other than that really close one...is that mysterious red cup.
P02	2	275	ok then i can see it
P02	2	276	but to me, it looks like it is closer to you than the yellow cup
P02	1	277	It is slightly closer
P02	1	278	But from my perspective. Only very slightly.
P02	2	279	because i can see the yellow cup's handle and it's closer to me tha the red one
P02	2	280	ok then we're not missing a red cup there, it's just a wonky table
P02	1	281	It does look like it might capsize
P02	1	282	Katie is judging us
P02	2	283	hahaha
P02	1	284	Okay, I can continue from that red cup.
P02	1	285	The mysterious one.
P02	2	286	ok
P02	1	287	Okay, so we have a white cup. The one that comes after that mysterious takeaway one you can't see.
P02	1	288	It has a handle
P02	1	289	The handle faces to your east
P02	2	290	yep got it
P02	1	291	Then we have a blue cup
P02	1	292	I doubt you can see the handle
P02	1	293	It faces my south east
P02	2	294	i can just see a bit of the handle
P02	1	295	It's near to 2
P02	2	296	NW
P02	1	297	Okay
P02	2	298	ok, that's it for that row?
P02	1	299	Yes
P02	2	300	ok
P02	1	301	Next we have 3 cups
P02	1	302	A blue cup C3 let's say.
P02	2	303	yeh
P02	1	304	A white cup. B3.
P02	2	305	handle my W
P02	1	306	Yes
P02	2	307	both the blue and white have W handles
P02	1	308	Correct
P02	2	309	ok
P02	1	310	Then lastly
P02	1	311	A takeaway cup
P02	2	312	yeh, ok
P02	2	313	i also see another white handled cup that is sort of in that line
P02	2	314	but a bit closer to me
P02	1	315	Hmm
P02	2	316	on teh A end, like A3ish
P02	1	317	Don't see it
P02	2	318	it could be obscured by the red at A1
P02	1	319	I have that yellow cup really close to you on your right. A4.
P02	1	320	Then the white takeaway.
P02	1	321	Then the blue. A2.
P02	2	322	i don't see a yellow at A4
P02	2	323	is that the yellow we were referring to before?
P02	1	324	Okay. Is there any yellow cup that is on your left?
P02	2	325	crap yes i misread
P02	1	326	Oh np
P02	1	327	It's a lot of text
P02	2	328	yes, there a yellow at A1
P02	1	329	Okay
P02	2	330	A4!
P02	1	331	Where the hell were we?
P02	1	332	I just talked about that white takeaway I think
P02	2	333	ok in front of the yellow A4 cup, which has a my west handle, i have a my west handled white cup too
P02	1	334	Oh...I don't see that
P02	1	335	Perhaps the yellow cup blocks it
P02	2	336	it is closer to you then the yellow one
P02	1	337	Hmm
P02	1	338	I mean
P02	1	339	In front of the yellow
P02	2	340	it is slightly closer to the A edge of the table
P02	1	341	In front for you I mean
P02	1	342	Would be the takeaway
P02	1	343	White
P02	2	344	i see the takeaway cup NE to the yellow cup
P02	1	345	Your NE?
P02	2	346	and the mystery white is NW
P02	2	347	yes
P02	1	348	I am having some compass problems
P02	2	349	ok
P02	1	350	Your NE is my...SW?
P02	2	351	the mystery white yes
P02	2	352	dammit
P02	1	353	So many mysteries
P02	1	354	Feel like I am in a fucking Scooby Doo episode
P02	2	355	i keep forgetting there's not ctr-A
P02	2	356	hahah
P02	2	357	omg i cannot type
P02	2	358	ok ok
P02	1	359	ahahaha
P02	1	360	So what are we doing about this mysterious white?
P02	1	361	Because we didn't need any more whites, I thought?
P02	1	362	Or we did
P02	1	363	Did we?
P02	2	364	yes, my NE is your SW - that's where the takeaway is from the yellow
P02	1	365	Yes, that is correct
P02	2	366	and the mystery white is like one cup my west awa from that
P02	2	367	closer to the edge of the table
P02	2	368	i believe we needed to find you a white cup
P02	1	369	Okay
P02	1	370	So
P02	1	371	This is it?
P02	1	372	I see 6 white cups
P02	2	373	with handles?
P02	2	374	or total
P02	2	375	total, wsn't it
P02	1	376	4 with handÃ¶es
P02	1	377	handles
P02	1	378	2 takeaway
P02	2	379	yeh so i think this might be the last one
P02	1	380	Okay
P02	2	381	because i see 5 with handles
P02	1	382	So it is in front of the takeaway cup that could be described as being at B3
P02	2	383	no
P02	1	384	aaaaaa
P02	2	385	it's closer to me than the takeaway cup
P02	2	386	but closer to you than the yellow one
P02	1	387	Okay
P02	1	388	Got it
P02	2	389	ok
P02	2	390	my west facing handle
P02	2	391	right by the edge of the table
P02	2	392	make sense?
P02	1	393	what are we talking about?
P02	1	394	the white cup?
P02	2	395	yes
P02	1	396	the handle direction
P02	2	397	your missing white ucp
P02	2	398	cup
P02	2	399	my west, your east
P02	1	400	which way does its handle face?
P02	2	401	it faces katie
P02	1	402	my east
P02	1	403	gotcha
P02	2	404	so. final count?
P02	1	405	4 red. 3 blue. 5 white with handles, 2 takeaway. 2 yellow.
P02	2	406	4 red, 3 blue, 3 takeaways and 5 whites
P02	2	407	OH
P02	2	408	we have a bonus takeaway
P02	1	409	Yes
P02	1	410	Maybe that one near me
P02	2	411	i see one in B4
P02	2	412	no, i counted that
P02	1	413	right...
P02	2	414	like, basically in the middle of the table, but close to me
